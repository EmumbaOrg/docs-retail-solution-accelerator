of an agentic workflow to personalize the product information section of an ecommerce page.

Following agents are available:

    the users profile and create customized description of the product based on the user profile.
  - Inventory Agent: Checks availability and related options based on users preference. Invoke if user
    has certain preferences that can be checked against the product inventory.
  - Reviews Agent: Answer queries related to product reviews. Can be used to generate personalized
