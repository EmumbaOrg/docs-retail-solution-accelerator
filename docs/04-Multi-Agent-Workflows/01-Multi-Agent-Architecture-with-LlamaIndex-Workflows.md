# 4.1 Multi-Agent Architecture with LlamaIndex Workflows

Modern applications powered by Generative AI often require multiple specialized agents working together to solve complex problems. In AgenticShop, we use **multi-agent workflows** to structure and coordinate tasks such as reviewing product data, updating personalization, performing vector search, and interacting with a userâ€™s memory.

## Why Use a Workflow?

Multi-agent systems can quickly become unmanageable without structureâ€”agents may step on each otherâ€™s toes or miss necessary context. The **LlamaIndex `Workflow` module** helps organize these agents into a clear, event-driven pipeline. Each component has a defined role, and execution is coordinated via **events** that guide the flow of information.

Workflows offer the following advantages:

- **Structured execution**: Define how and when each step is triggered.
- **Event-driven orchestration**: Steps listen for and emit events to communicate.
- **Composable design**: Add, remove, or replace logic easily as your system evolves.
- **Traceability**: Workflows can be monitored end-to-end, making debugging easier.

### How It Works

At a high level, a LlamaIndex `Workflow` consists of:

- **Steps** â€“ These are the individual units of execution in the workflow. Each step performs a specific task and can wrap:
  - An **Agent** for complex reasoning and multi-turn capabilities
  - A **Function** for logic such as formatting or transforming data
  - A **Tool** for invoking structured tools
  - A **Router** to direct flow based on logic or message content
- **Events** â€“ Events are structured messages that trigger workflow steps. Each step listens for one or more `EventType`s as input and emits one or more `EventType`s as output. Events carry the context that allows the workflow to evolve dynamically.
- **Workflow Execution** â€“ Execution starts with `workflow.run(input_event)`, which dispatches the initial event. From there, steps respond to incoming events, perform their tasks, and emit new events that trigger downstream steps. This event-driven chaining enables flexible, reactive workflows.

Each step is defined with clear input and output events, enabling modular, scalable orchestration of multiple agents and tools.

### What You'll Implement

In this guide, youâ€™ll inspect:

- A multi-agent `Workflow` that connects planning, personalization, inventory and presentation logic is already provided.
- A **Review Agent** that answers users query based on product reviews.
- An **event-based system** where steps react to emitted data rather than executing in a rigid sequence.
- Integration of memory and retrieval (RAG)

By structuring your agents using LlamaIndex workflows, you'll gain not only modularity and maintainabilityâ€”but also the ability to scale your application to handle more complex tasks with intelligent orchestration.
