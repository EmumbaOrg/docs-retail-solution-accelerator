# 4.2 Multi-Agent Workflow Implementation

This section provides a deep dive into the **multi-agent workflow** implemented in AgenticShop. You’ll learn how the architecture ties together multiple specialized agents—each with distinct responsibilities—and how these agents collaborate via LlamaIndex Workflows to personalize product experiences.

We’ll walk through:

- The **overall agent roles**
- A detailed look at the **Product Personalization Agent**
- How **user memory** enhances personalization
- The **anatomy of an agent** in our implementation

## Agent Overview

The current multi-agent system includes the following agents:

| Agent                    | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planner Agent**       | Determines which agents to invoke based on user query and profile.                          |
| **Product Personalization Agent** | Tailors product descriptions to the user’s preferences.                            |
| **Inventory Agent**     | Analyzes inventory constraints and availability.                                            |
| **Presentation Agent**  | Synthesizes responses from other agents into a final, user-facing product description.      |

Agents are connected through **events** and executed via the LlamaIndex `Workflow` system, which provides modularity, traceability, and event-driven orchestration.

## Example: Product Personalization Agent

Let’s walk through one of the core agents—**Product Personalization Agent**—and how it operates within the workflow.

When triggered, it receives user profile data, product attributes, and product variants. It then uses this context to generate a personalized product summary.

### Event Flow

- Triggered by: `ProductPersonalizationEvent`
- Returns: `ProductPersonalizationCompletedEvent`

```python
result = await self.product_personalization_agent.run(
    f"""Personalize the product for user: {user_info},
    product: {product_info}, product variants: {variants_info}""",
    timeout=settings.PRODUCT_PERSONALIZATION_AGENT_TIMEOUT,
)
```

If the agent fails to respond within the timeout, a fallback message is returned to ensure the workflow continues.

## Anatomy of an Agent

Agents in AgenticShop are implemented using LlamaIndex’s `FunctionAgent`. Each agent wraps a system prompt and has a clear role.

Here’s how the **Product Personalization Agent** is defined:

```python
return FunctionAgent(
    name=AgentNames.PRODUCT_PERSONALIZATION_AGENT.value,
    description=(
        "Analyzes user profiles and product data to highlight features most relevant to individual preferences."
    ),
    llm=llm,
    system_prompt=PRODUCT_PERSONALIZATION_AGENT_PROMPT,
    tools=[],
    allow_parallel_tool_calls=False,
    verbose=settings.VERBOSE,
)
```

### Where to Find System Prompts

All system prompts for these agents are defined in:

```bash
backend/src/agents/prompts.py
```

You can modify the tone, structure, or output expectations of each agent by editing the associated prompt in this file.

## Memory Integration

The system uses `mem0` to personalize interactions based on **user memory**. Here’s how memory contributes:

- During **workflow setup**, user preferences are retrieved from memory and included in the profile.
- If a user adds new input (e.g., "I care about portability"), it’s stored back to memory.
- Memory influences agent outputs like personalization.

### Memory Update Example

```python
results = self.memory.add(messages=user_msg, user_id=str(user_id))
```

These updates are stored in PostgreSQL under the `mem0_chatstore` table.
