# 3.7: Reset Database

The Reset button present on the frontend products page allows users to restore the database to its original post-setup stateâ€”i.e., immediately after the application is initialized and migrations are run.
It triggers the reset service present at 'backend/src/services/reset.py'.

This reset operation clears all personalized data generated during application usage:

- **personalized_product_sections** table: Stores personalized UI content for each user/product combination. When a user revisits a product, this table is checked first. If personalization exists, it is reused; otherwise, a new personalization flow is triggered. The reset service clears all entries from this table.
- **mem0_chatstore** table: Holds user preferences. Initially, it contains predefined preferences added during migrations for all user profiles (Alex, Eugene, Paul). As users interact with the app, additional preferences are stored in this table. The reset service removes preferences added during runtime and restores only the original ones.

This feature ensures a clean testing or demo environment by removing accumulated state while preserving the baseline data defined during setup.
