# 3.5 Generating Features and Sentiments

In this section, you'll explore how the AgenticShop application uses **in-database AI** to extract valuable insights from raw product reviews.

Thanks to the `azure_ai` extension in Azure Database for PostgreSQL, we can embed powerful language models directly into SQL queries. This enables us to process reviews and identify:

- **Which product feature** a user is talking about
- **What sentiment** (positive, negative, or neutral) they express about that feature

These insights help populate the `product_reviews` table with structured fields like `feature_id` and `sentiment`, which downstream agents and search systems rely on.

## Try It Yourself: Extract Sentiment from a Review

Hereâ€™s an example SQL query that demonstrates how we use the `azure_ai.extract` function to classify sentiment. You can run this using Postgres extension of VS Code to see it in action.

### ðŸ“Œ Use Case: Sentiment Classification

!!! tip "You can run this command using the Postgres Extension to try out generating the sentiment."
Query:

```sql
SELECT azure_ai.extract(
  'Review: The battery life is incredible.',
  ARRAY['sentiment - sentiment about the feature as in positive, negative, or neutral'],
  model => 'gpt-4o'
) ->> 'sentiment' AS sentiment;
```

Expected Output:

```
sentiment
----------
positive
```

## Try It Yourself: Extract the Product Feature Being Mentioned

This example shows how to extract **which feature** is being talked about in the review. We guide the LLM using a **schema prompt** listing possible feature names.

!!! tip "You can run this command using Postgres extension for VS code to try out extracting product feature."
Query:

```sql
SELECT azure_ai.extract(
  'I love how lightweight and portable this device is.',
  ARRAY['productFeature: string - A feature of a product. Features should be from: weight, battery life, screen quality, portability or NULL'],
  model => 'gpt-4o'
) ->> 'productFeature' AS extracted_feature;
```

Expected Output:

```
extracted_feature
--------------------
portability
```

!!! note "ðŸ§  The AI model picks from the list of feature names you provide in the schema prompt. This is why the feature list is aggregated dynamically in the actual workflow."

## Behind the Scenes

Although youâ€™re testing this manually here, the production system runs these AI queries in **batches** as part of the data ingestion pipeline using Alembic migrations. During deployment:

- Reviews are processed in chunks
- Each review is paired with the most likely features based on its product
- The `azure_ai.extract()` function is used to assign feature IDs and sentiments directly in SQL

This approach keeps everything **in-database**, minimizing round-trips and making the AI processing fully declarative and observable.

## Configurable Execution for Faster Migrations

The sentiment and feature extraction runs as part of Alembic migrations using `azure_ai.extract()` in batch mode. However, to speed up migrations during development or testing, weâ€™ve introduced a feature flag: `USE_AZURE_AI_FOR_REVIEWS`.

When this flag is set to `True`, reviews are processed using live AI queries.

If the flag is `False` (the default), no AI queries are executed during migration, and instead, the migration loads pre-computed sentiment and feature data from a CSV file.

This approach balances the power of in-database AI with flexibility and speedâ€”especially useful for CI pipelines or faster local setup. You can modify this logic in the Alembic migration script if needed.
