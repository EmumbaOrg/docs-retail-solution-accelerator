# 2.8 Setting Up Environment (.env) Files

Environment variable files (`.env`) are essential for securely managing configuration values such as API keys, service URLs, and secrets for each application component. This section guides you through setting up `.env` files for the **frontend**, **backend**, and **arize-ai** services.

---

## 1. Overview

After deploying your services on Azure (see section 2.6), a `.env` file is generated in the **root directory** of your project. This file contains all the necessary environment variable values (URLs, keys, etc.) for the deployed services. You do **not** need to manually retrieve these values from the Azure portal.

**To complete your setup:**
- Copy the relevant variables from the root `.env` file into the `.env` files for each service as described below.

## 2. Backend: Setting up `.env` file

1. In the `backend` directory, create a file named `.env` if it does not already exist.
2. Copy the backend-related variables from the root `.env` file. Typical variables include:
    - `DB_HOST`
    - `DB_PASSWORD`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
    - `AZURE_API_VERSION`
    - Any other variables required by the backend (refer to sample `.env.example`).
3. Paste these variables values into `backend/.env`.

---

## 3. Frontend: Setting up `.env` file

1. In the `frontend` directory, create a copy of file named `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` if it does not already exist.
2. Set the below variable to the following.
    - `VITE_BE_APP_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
    - Any other variables required by the frontend (refer to sample `.env.example` if available).

---

## 4. Arize-AI: Setting up `.env` file

1. In the `arize-ai` directory, create a file named `.env` if it does not already exist.
2. Copy the Arize-related variables from the root `.env` file. Typical variables include:
    - `PHOENIX_SQL_DATABASE_URL`
    - Any other variables required by Arize (refer to Arize documentation or sample `.env.example` if available).
3. Paste these variables into `arize-ai/.env`.

---

## 5. Summary

- After every deployment, always update your service-specific `.env` files with the latest values from the root `.env` file.
- This process ensures each app has the correct configuration and can connect to the necessary Azure resources securely.

> **Tip:** Never commit `.env` files with secrets to version control. Use `.gitignore` to keep them private.
