# 4.1 Multi-Agent Architecture with LlamaIndex Workflows

Modern applications powered by Generative AI often require multiple specialized agents working together to solve complex problems. In AgenticShop, we use **multi-agent workflows** to structure and coordinate tasks such as reviewing product data, updating personalization, performing vector search, and interacting with a userâ€™s memory.

### Why Use a Workflow?

Multi-agent systems can quickly become unmanageable without structureâ€”agents may step on each otherâ€™s toes or miss necessary context. The **LlamaIndex `Workflow` module** helps organize these agents into a clear, event-driven pipeline. Each component has a defined role, and execution is coordinated via **events** that guide the flow of information.

Workflows offer the following advantages:

- **Structured execution**: Define how and when each step is triggered.
- **Event-driven orchestration**: Steps listen for and emit events to communicate.
- **Composable design**: Add, remove, or replace logic easily as your system evolves.
- **Traceability**: Workflows can be monitored end-to-end, making debugging easier.

### ðŸ§¹ How It Works

At a high level, a LlamaIndex `Workflow` consists of:

1. **Steps** â€“ These are the individual units of execution in the workflow. Each step performs a specific task and can wrap:
   - An **Agent** for complex reasoning and multi-turn capabilities
   - A **Function** for logic such as formatting or transforming data
   - A **Tool** for invoking structured tools
   - A **Router** to direct flow based on logic or message content

2. **Events** â€“ Events are structured messages that trigger workflow steps. Each step listens for one or more `EventType`s as input and emits one or more `EventType`s as output. Events carry the context that allows the workflow to evolve dynamically.

3. **Workflow Execution** â€“ Execution starts with `workflow.run(input_event)`, which dispatches the initial event. From there, steps respond to incoming events, perform their tasks, and emit new events that trigger downstream steps. This event-driven chaining enables flexible, reactive workflows.

In **AgenticShop**, this might look like:

- A **Planning step** receives a user query and emits sub-task events.
- A **Review step** handles `ReviewAnalysisRequested` events to extract sentiment and features using Azure AI.
- A **Personalization step** listens for `UserPreferenceUpdate` events and modifies user memory using `mem0`.
- A **Presentation step** listens for final results and prepares the response for display in the UI.

Each step is defined with clear input and output events, enabling modular, scalable orchestration of multiple agents and tools.

### ðŸ›  What You'll Implement

In this workshop, youâ€™ll implement or inspect:

- A multi-agent `Workflow` that connects planning, review analysis, personalization, and presentation logic.
- A **Review Agent step** that processes sentiment and features from product reviews.
- An **event-based system** where steps react to emitted data rather than executing in a rigid sequence.
- Integration of memory and retrieval (RAG) using **LlamaIndex tools and context**.

By structuring your agents using LlamaIndex workflows, you'll gain not only modularity and maintainabilityâ€”but also the ability to scale your application to handle more complex tasks with intelligent orchestration.
